Netty is more of a personal project of mine that I am passionate about, orignially I created it with the intention of my own vison of [#CancelCancelCulture](https://twitter.com/hashtag/cancelcancelculture), it allowes for people to make their own communities with their own rules.

Netty won @ "ASEDF & STEAM" a competion held in Tiran, Albania [@Barlet University](https://www.umb.edu.al/)
